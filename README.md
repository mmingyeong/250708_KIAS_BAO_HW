# BAO Figure Reproduction: Seo & Eisenstein (2003)

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that reproduces **Figure 3** from the seminal paper:

> Seo, Hee-Jong, and Daniel J. Eisenstein.  
> *"Probing Dark Energy with Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations from Future Large Galaxy Redshift Surveys."*  
> The Astrophysical Journal 598.2 (2003): 720.  
> [DOI: 10.1086/379122](https://doi.org/10.1086/379122)

## ðŸ§ª Objective

The notebook demonstrates how the expected accuracy of the angular diameter distance and Hubble parameter measurements varies as a function of redshift and survey volume. This is achieved by numerically reproducing the Fisher matrixâ€“based calculations shown in **Figure 3** of the paper.
